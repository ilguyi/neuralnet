# neuralnet using backpropagation


version 0.1 (2015. 07. 12)
I use the random number generator mt19937 from Boost library
for weights and bias initailization and stochastic gradient
descent.
I implement my program using Armadillo linear algebra library in C++
for various calculation based on matrix and vector.
